Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used in this project is a synthetic Titanic dataset generated for educational purposes.

# Overview
Building a system to predict whether a person would survive the Titanic sinking can be achieved using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this task usually contains information about passengers, including their socio-economic status, age, gender, and more, along with a binary label indicating whether they survived or not.

Here's a step-by-step guide to building such a system:

1. Data Collection: Obtain a dataset that contains information about the Titanic passengers, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, cabin class, family size, fare, etc. You can find datasets for this task on various platforms like Kaggle.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical features to numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding for gender) and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.

3. Feature Selection: Analyze the dataset and select relevant features that may have a significant impact on survival (e.g., socio-economic status, age, gender, cabin class, etc.).

4. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

5. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for this classification task. Common algorithms used for binary classification tasks include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).

6. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training set using the selected features.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

8. Interpretation: Analyze the model's results to understand which factors had the most significant impact on survival. You can use feature importance scores provided by some algorithms (e.g., Random Forests) or perform feature analysis to gain insights.

9. Model Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it as a prediction system that takes input features (e.g., socio-economic status, age, gender) and predicts whether the person is likely to survive or not.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified overview, and the actual implementation might require more fine-tuning and feature engineering. Additionally, always ensure to validate the model's results and avoid overfitting by using proper cross-validation techniques during model training.

Remember, the Titanic dataset is a classic example used to learn about data analysis and machine learning, but it's essential to consider more diverse and up-to-date datasets for real-world applications.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and Embarked. The target variable is 'Survived,' which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). I have used this dataset in this project:- https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/tree/master/titanic.csv

To run the code in this project, you need the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- faker (for generating synthetic data)

You can install these libraries using pip:
