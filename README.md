Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used in this project is a synthetic Titanic dataset generated for educational purposes.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and Embarked. The target variable is 'Survived,' which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). I have used this dataset in this project:- titanic.csv

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- faker (for generating synthetic data)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn faker
